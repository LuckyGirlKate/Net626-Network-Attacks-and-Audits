Lesson 3: Network Security Fundamentals Lab Report

Introduction:
In this lab, you will practice network security concepts and techniques, including network segmentation, firewall configuration, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), wireless network security, and network monitoring. You will work in a lab environment using VMware Workstation with an Ubuntu server and Kali Linux instance.

Lab Environment Setup:
1. Open VMware Workstation and ensure you have an Ubuntu Server and a Kali Linux virtual machine set up.
2. Start both virtual machines and ensure they are connected to the same virtual network.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Network Segmentation:
   a. Create VLANs on your virtual switches, following your group's unique VLAN ID assignment (e.g., VLAN 10, VLAN 20, etc.).
   b. Configure inter-VLAN routing on your virtual routers to segment the network.
   c. Test the network segmentation by attempting to communicate with other VLANs.
   Screenshot: Submit a screenshot showing successful network segmentation.

   Question 1: What are the benefits of network segmentation in terms of security and network performance?

2. Firewall Configuration:
   a. Implement your group's assigned security policies on your virtual firewalls.
   b. Configure the firewalls to filter traffic between network segments based on the assigned security policies.
   c. Test the firewall configuration by sending traffic that should be blocked according to your assigned policies.
   Screenshot: Submit a screenshot showing the firewall configuration and a test of the firewall rules.

   Question 2: How do firewalls contribute to network security, and what are some common types of firewall policies?

3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):
   a. Configure your IDS/IPS with the provided rules to detect potential security threats.
   b. Set up the IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and enforce the rules.
   c. Test the IDS/IPS configuration by simulating network traffic that should trigger alerts.
   Screenshot: Submit a screenshot showing the IDS/IPS configuration and a triggered alert.

   Question 3: What is the difference between an IDS and an IPS, and how do they contribute to network security?

4. Wireless Network Security:
   a. Configure a wireless access point with proper security settings (e.g., WPA3 encryption, strong passwords).
   b. Set up a guest network with appropriate security measures.
   Screenshot: Submit a screenshot showing the wireless access point configuration and the guest network settings.

   Question 4: What are some best practices for securing wireless networks, and why are they important?

5. Network Monitoring:
   a. Use network monitoring tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture network traffic.
   b. Analyze the captured traffic to identify potential security risks or suspicious activities.
   Screenshot: Submit a screenshot of the network monitoring tool with captured traffic and any identified security risks.

   Question 5: What are the benefits of network monitoring, and how can it help improve network security?
