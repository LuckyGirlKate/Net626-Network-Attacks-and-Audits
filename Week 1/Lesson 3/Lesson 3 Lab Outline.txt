Lesson 3 Lab Outline:

1. Lab Objective:
   - The objective of this lab is to provide students with hands-on experience in implementing secure network design strategies and to reinforce the concepts covered in the lecture.

2. Lab Overview:
   - In this lab, students will work with various tools and technologies to create a secure network environment, focusing on network segmentation, firewall configuration, intrusion detection and prevention systems, wireless network security, and network monitoring.

3. Lab Setup:
   - Students will have access to a virtual environment with multiple virtual machines (VMs) configured to simulate different network components and devices. These VMs include routers, switches, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and a wireless access point.
   - Before the lab, the instructor will need to prepare the virtual environment by creating the required VMs and ensuring they have the necessary software installed.

4. Lab Activities:
   1. Network segmentation:
      - Students will create VLANs on switches and configure inter-VLAN routing on routers to segment the network.
   2. Firewall configuration:
      - Students will configure a firewall to filter traffic between network segments based on specified security policies.
   3. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS):
      - Students will configure an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats.
   4. Wireless network security:
      - Students will configure a wireless access point with proper security settings (e.g., WPA3 encryption, strong passwords) and set up a guest network.
   5. Network monitoring:
      - Students will use network monitoring tools to analyze network traffic and identify potential security risks.

5. Lab Deliverables:
   - After completing the lab activities, students will submit a lab report outlining their configurations, observations, and any challenges they faced during the lab. Additionally, students will provide screenshots of their completed tasks as evidence of their work.

6. Lab Assessment:
   - The lab report and screenshots will be assessed by the instructor to determine the students' understanding of the concepts covered in the lecture and their ability to apply them in a practical setting.
