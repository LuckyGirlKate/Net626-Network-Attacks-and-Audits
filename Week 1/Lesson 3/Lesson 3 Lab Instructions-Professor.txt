Lesson 3 Professor Lab Instructions

Introduction:
In this lab exercise, students will learn about network security concepts and techniques, including network segmentation, firewall configuration, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), wireless network security, and network monitoring. Professors should provide guidance to students throughout the lab, ensuring they understand the concepts and can apply them in practice.

Lab Environment Setup:
1. Ensure each student or group of students has access to a computer with VMware Workstation installed.
2. Ensure that students have an Ubuntu Server and a Kali Linux virtual machine set up in their VMware Workstation environment.

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. Network Segmentation:
   a. Divide the class into up to six groups, assigning each group a unique VLAN ID (e.g., Group 1: VLAN 10, Group 2: VLAN 20, etc.).
   b. Have students create VLANs on their virtual switches and configure inter-VLAN routing on their virtual routers.
   c. Verify that the VLANs are functioning correctly and that the groups can only communicate with their assigned VLAN.

2. Firewall Configuration:
   a. Assign each group a specific set of security policies to implement on their virtual firewalls.
   b. Have students configure the firewalls to filter traffic between network segments based on their assigned security policies.
   c. Verify that the firewalls are functioning correctly and that they are filtering traffic as expected.

3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):
   a. Provide students with a set of rules to configure their IDS/IPS to detect potential security threats.
   b. Have students configure their IDS/IPS systems to monitor network traffic and enforce the provided rules.
   c. Monitor the IDS/IPS systems to ensure they are correctly identifying and blocking potential threats.

4. Wireless Network Security:
   a. Assign each group a wireless access point to configure with proper security settings, such as WPA3 encryption and strong passwords.
   b. Have students set up a guest network on their wireless access points with restricted access to the main network.
   c. Verify that the wireless networks are secure and that the guest networks have limited access to network resources.

5. Network Monitoring:
   a. Provide students with a list of network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) to analyze network traffic and identify potential security risks.
   b. Have students perform various network activities while monitoring network traffic, looking for unusual patterns or suspicious IP addresses.
   c. Encourage students to use the tools' filtering capabilities to focus on specific protocols or IP addresses during analysis.

Safety Guidelines:
1. Ensure that students are working in a safe and controlled lab environment, with appropriate supervision.
2. Remind students not to attempt any unauthorized access to networks or systems, as this may result in legal consequences.

Professor Tips:
1. Encourage students to collaborate and share their findings with their group members.
2. Provide real-world examples and scenarios to help students understand the importance of each concept.
3. Encourage students to ask questions and engage in discussion throughout the lab exercise.
4. Walk around the lab, observing student progress, and offering assistance as needed.
5. Conduct a debriefing session at the end of the lab, discussing key takeaways and addressing any remaining questions or concerns.
