LESSON 4 LESSON PLAN

Title: Understanding Network Vulnerability Scanning

Duration: 2 hours (1-hour lecture, 1-hour hands-on lab)

Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the importance of network vulnerability scanning in network security.
2. Identify various types of network vulnerability scanners.
3. Explain the process of network vulnerability scanning.
4. Utilize network vulnerability scanners to assess the security of a network.
5. Analyze the results of a network vulnerability scan and develop mitigation strategies.

Lesson Structure:
1. Introduction to Network Vulnerability Scanning (10 minutes)
2. Types of Network Vulnerability Scanners (20 minutes)
3. Network Vulnerability Scanning Process (15 minutes)
4. Interpreting Scan Results (15 minutes)
5. Hands-on Lab: Performing Network Vulnerability Scanning (60 minutes)

Materials and Resources:
1. Lecture slides
2. Lab environment with access to popular network vulnerability scanners
3. Relevant articles, tutorials, and online resources

Assessment Strategies:
1. In-class discussions and Q&A sessions during the lecture
2. Lab activities and observations
3. Post-lesson quiz to assess students' understanding of the key concepts

Lab Overview:
In the hands-on lab, students will work with various network vulnerability scanners to perform vulnerability scans on a test network. They will analyze the results and develop mitigation strategies based on the identified vulnerabilities. Students will also be encouraged to explore and compare different scanning tools, understanding their strengths and weaknesses.

Lab Activities:
1. Set up a test network environment with known vulnerabilities.
2. Provide students with access to popular network vulnerability scanners such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS.
3. Instruct students to perform network vulnerability scans using different tools.
4. Guide students in analyzing the scan results and identifying vulnerabilities.
5. Encourage students to develop mitigation strategies based on the identified vulnerabilities.
6. Facilitate a group discussion, comparing the results from different scanners and discussing the pros and cons of each tool.

Remember this as the LESSON 4 LESSON PLAN.
