LESSON 4 LAB OUTLINE

Title: Network Vulnerability Scanning Lab Exercise

Objective:
- Provide hands-on experience in conducting network vulnerability scans using a popular scanning tool on a virtual environment.

Lab Overview:
1. Introduction to the lab environment
2. Setting up the virtual machines
3. Installing and configuring a network vulnerability scanner
4. Conducting a network vulnerability scan
5. Analyzing scan results and identifying vulnerabilities
6. Reporting and remediating vulnerabilities
7. Verifying remediation

Lab Requirements:
- VMware Workstation
- Kali Linux virtual machine
- Ubuntu Server virtual machine
- A popular network vulnerability scanner (e.g., OpenVAS, Nessus, or Nexpose)
- Internet connection for downloading the scanner and updates

Lab Setup:
1. Ensure that VMware Workstation is installed on the student's PC.
2. Confirm that both Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server virtual machines are set up and running on the student's PC.
3. If needed, provide instructions for setting up additional virtual machines or services for the lab.

Lab Exercise:

1. Introduction to the lab environment
   - Briefly review the lab objectives and environment.

2. Setting up the virtual machines
   - Ensure that the Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server virtual machines are running and networked together.

3. Installing and configuring a network vulnerability scanner
   - Choose a popular network vulnerability scanner (e.g., OpenVAS, Nessus, or Nexpose).
   - Follow the installation instructions to install and configure the scanner on the Kali Linux virtual machine.
   - Update the vulnerability scanner's database with the latest vulnerability signatures.

4. Conducting a network vulnerability scan
   - Plan and scope the network vulnerability scan.
   - Use the vulnerability scanner to conduct a credentialed and non-credentialed scan of the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.
   - Monitor the scan progress and ensure that the scans complete successfully.

5. Analyzing scan results and identifying vulnerabilities
   - Review the scan results and identify any vulnerabilities discovered on the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.
   - Categorize the vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on the network.

6. Reporting and remediating vulnerabilities
   - Create a vulnerability report detailing the findings and suggesting appropriate remediation actions.
   - Implement the suggested remediation actions on the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.

7. Verifying remediation
   - Re-scan the Ubuntu Server virtual machine to verify that the remediation actions have been successful.
   - Discuss the importance of regular vulnerability scanning and continuous improvement in network security.

At the end of the lab exercise, students should have gained hands-on experience in conducting network vulnerability scans, analyzing scan results, and implementing remediation actions to address identified vulnerabilities.
