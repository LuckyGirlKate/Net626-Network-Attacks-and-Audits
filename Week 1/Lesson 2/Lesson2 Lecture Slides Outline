Title: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
Bullets:
- IDS vs. IPS
- Signature-Based Detection
- Anomaly-Based Detection
- Implementing IDS/IPS

Detailed Speaking Script:
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are essential tools for network security. While IDS monitors network traffic and alerts administrators to suspicious activity, IPS takes it a step further by actively blocking potential threats. Both systems can use signature-based detection, which relies on known patterns of malicious activity, or anomaly-based detection, which identifies unusual behavior that deviates from normal network traffic.

Encryption is a vital component of network security. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption, which uses a pair of keys (public and private). Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that manages the creation, distribution, and revocation of digital certificates. Proper key management practices are essential to ensure the security of encrypted data.
