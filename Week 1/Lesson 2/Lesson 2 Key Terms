Lesson 2 Key Terms
Network architecture - The design principles, physical and logical layout, and infrastructure of a network.
Network security protocol - A set of rules and procedures designed to secure data transmission and communication over a network.
Security threat - Any potential danger or risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a network and its resources.
Confidentiality - The protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
Integrity - Ensuring that data is accurate and consistent, and has not been tampered with or modified by unauthorized users.
Availability - Ensuring that network resources and services are accessible to authorized users when needed.
OSI model - The Open Systems Interconnection model, a framework for understanding network communication by dividing it into seven layers.
TCP/IP model - The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol model, a simplified networking framework used to establish connections and transmit data across the internet.
Encryption - The process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
Authentication - The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system attempting to access network resources.
Authorization - The process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the authenticated identity of a user or device.
Network perimeter - The boundary between an organization's internal network and the external networks, such as the internet.
Firewall - A security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - A system that monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity or policy violations and generates alerts when such activity is detected.
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - A system that not only detects potential threats but also takes action to block or prevent them from causing harm to the network.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) - A secure, encrypted connection between a user or device and a private network, often used to protect data transmission over the public internet.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - A cryptographic protocol used to secure data transmission over a network, often used in web browsing and email communication.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) - An updated and more secure version of SSL, also used for securing data transmission over a network.
Denial of Service (DoS) attack - A type of network attack where an attacker attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a network or system by overwhelming its resources.
Man-in-the-middle attack - A type of network attack where an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
