Lesson 2 Lab Setup Instructions for the Professor:

Pre-lab setup:

a. Review the lab instructions and ensure you are familiar with the tools and concepts to be covered.
b. Prepare the necessary software and tools for the lab:

SSH client (e.g., PuTTY for Windows or the built-in SSH client on macOS and Linux)
Wireshark
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
Virtual Machines and Networking:

a. Verify that the students have access to VMWare Workstation with the necessary licenses to create virtual machines.
b. Ensure that the students have the necessary VMs set up from Lesson 1:

Kali Linux VM
Ubuntu Server VM
c. Ensure that the VMs are configured to have network connectivity with each other and the host machine. The network should be set up as a host-only network to avoid interference with external networks.
Software installation and configuration:

a. Verify that the necessary software is installed on the Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server VMs:

SSH server on Ubuntu Server VM
Wireshark on Kali Linux VM
b. Ensure that the SSH server on the Ubuntu Server VM is up and running, and that the firewall is set up to allow SSH traffic.
Preparing demonstration materials:

a. Prepare examples and demonstrations for using SSH, TLS, IPsec, UFW, and Wireshark to show the students how to apply these security protocols and tools in practice.

In-class support:

a. Be prepared to assist students with any questions or issues they may encounter during the lab.
b. Monitor students' progress and provide guidance as needed to ensure they complete the lab successfully.

With these setup instructions, you should be prepared to effectively guide your students through the Lesson 2 Lab on network security fundamentals.
