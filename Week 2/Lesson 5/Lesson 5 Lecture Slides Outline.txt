LESSON 5 POWERPOINT:

Slide 1: Introduction
- Recap of lessons 1-4
- Network penetration testing definition: A simulated cyber attack to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a network

Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 2: What is Network Penetration Testing?
- Simulated cyber attack
- Objective: Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Improve network security posture
Slide Image Suggestion: Penetration testing process diagram
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 3: Types of Penetration Testing - Overview
- Black box testing: Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system
- White box testing: Tester has full knowledge of the target system
- Gray box testing: Tester has partial knowledge of the target system
Slide Image Suggestion: Three different colored boxes representing each type of testing
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 4: Black Box Testing
- No prior knowledge
- Advantage: Mimics real-world attack scenario
- Disadvantage: Can be time-consuming
Slide Image Suggestion: A black box with a question mark
Slide Example or Case Study: A company that benefited from black box testing

Slide 5: White Box Testing
- Full knowledge of the system
- Advantage: Comprehensive testing
- Disadvantage: May overlook issues an outsider could exploit
Slide Image Suggestion: A white box with an open lid, revealing gears inside
Slide Example or Case Study: A company that benefited from white box testing

Slide 6: Gray Box Testing
- Partial knowledge
- Advantage: Balanced approach
- Disadvantage: May not be as comprehensive as white box testing
Slide Image Suggestion: A gray box with a combination of question marks and gears
Slide Example or Case Study: A company that benefited from gray box testing

Slide 7: Importance of Penetration Testing in Network Auditing
- Find vulnerabilities before attackers do
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Maintain customer trust and brand reputation
Slide Image Suggestion: Shield and lock representing network security
Slide Example or Case Study: A company that avoided a major breach

Slide 8: Penetration Testing Methodology
- Planning and reconnaissance
- Scanning and enumeration
- Gaining access
- Maintaining access
- Analysis and reporting
Slide Image Suggestion: A flowchart depicting the penetration testing process
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 9: Planning and Reconnaissance
- Define scope and goals
- Gather information about the target
- Identify potential vulnerabilities
Slide Image Suggestion: A planning board with notes and diagrams
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 10: Scanning and Enumeration
- Identify open ports and services
- Discover network topology
- Fingerprint operating systems
Slide Image Suggestion: A magnifying glass scanning a network diagram
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 11: Gaining Access
- Exploit identified vulnerabilities
- Gain unauthorized access to the target
- Escalate privileges
Slide Image Suggestion: A hacker breaking into a computer system
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 12: Maintaining Access
- Establish persistence in the target system
- Bypass security measures
- Gather sensitive data
Slide Image Suggestion: A hacker icon connected to a network
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A

Slide 13: Analysis and Reporting
- Document findings and evidence
- Evaluate security posture
- Provide recommendations for improvement
Slide Image Suggestion: A report with graphs and charts
Slide Example or Case Study: N/A
