Lab Environment Setup (Revised):
1. Download and install the Metasploitable VM (https://information.rapid7.com/download-metasploitable-2017.html) as the target system.

2. Set up a new virtual network in VMware Workstation:
   a. Open VMware Workstation and go to the "Edit" menu.
   b. Select "Virtual Network Editor."
   c. Click on "Add Network" and choose a network name (e.g., VMnet2).
   d. Configure the new network by selecting "Host-only" under the "Type" section.
   e. Check the "Connect a host virtual adapter to this network" option.
   f. Uncheck the "Use local DHCP service to distribute IP addresses" option, as we will manually configure the IP addresses for the virtual machines.
   g. Click "OK" to save the configuration.

3. Configure the network settings of the Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, and Metasploitable VMs to ensure they are on the same virtual network.
   a. For each VM (Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, and Metasploitable), perform the following steps:
      i. Power off the VM if it is running.
      ii. Right-click on the VM in the library and select "Settings."
      iii. Click on the "Network Adapter" option.
      iv. In the "Network Connection" section, select "Custom" and choose the network you created in step 2 (e.g., VMnet2).
      v. Click "OK" to save the changes.

4. Manually assign IP addresses to the VMs:
   a. Power on each VM and log in.
   b. Configure the network interface with a static IP address on the same subnet. For example, assign the following IP addresses:
      - Kali Linux: 192.168.100.2/24
      - Ubuntu Server: 192.168.100.3/24
      - Metasploitable: 192.168.100.4/24
   c. To configure the network interface on Kali Linux and Ubuntu Server, open the terminal and enter the following command:

      `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`

      Edit the file to include the appropriate static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. Save the changes and exit.

   d. For Metasploitable, follow the on-screen instructions after logging in to set the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.

5. Verify that all VMs are on the same virtual network by pinging the IP addresses of each machine from the other machines.
LESSON 5 STUDENT LAB INSTRUCTIONS (Continued):

Introduction:
In this lab, you will use the Kali Linux VM to perform a network penetration test on the Metasploitable VM. You will use various tools to scan for vulnerabilities, exploit them, and gain unauthorized access to the target system.

Step-by-Step Lab Procedure:

1. Open your Kali Linux VM and launch the terminal.

2. Begin by scanning the target Metasploitable VM using Nmap to identify open ports and services. Replace the target IP address with the one you assigned to Metasploitable VM:

   ```
   nmap -sV -p- 192.168.100.4
   ```

3. Analyze the Nmap output to identify potential vulnerabilities based on the open ports and running services.

4. Choose a vulnerability you identified from the Nmap output. Look up the vulnerability in the Exploit Database (https://www.exploit-db.com/) to find an appropriate exploit.

5. Use the Metasploit Framework on your Kali Linux VM to exploit the vulnerability. Launch Metasploit by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   msfconsole
   ```

6. Load the exploit you found in the Exploit Database by typing:

   ```
   use [exploit_path]
   ```

7. Set the RHOSTS variable to the IP address of your target Metasploitable VM:

   ```
   set RHOSTS 192.168.100.4
   ```

8. Configure any other required options for the exploit. You can view these options by typing:

   ```
   show options
   ```

9. Launch the exploit by typing:

   ```
   exploit
   ```

10. 10. If the exploit is successful, you should gain unauthorized access to the target system. Explore the system by following these steps:

   a. List the directories and files you have access to by typing:

      ```
      ls
      ```

   b. Navigate through the directories using the 'cd' command. For example, to enter the 'Documents' directory, type:

      ```
      cd Documents
      ```

   c. To view the content of a file, use the 'cat' command followed by the filename. For example:

      ```
      cat sample.txt
      ```

   d. Check the current user by typing:

      ```
      whoami
      ```

   e. Attempt to escalate privileges using the 'sudo' command or by searching for and exploiting local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

   f. Document the steps you took, the directories and files you accessed, and any sensitive information you found during your exploration of the target system.

After completing the exploration, answer the lab questions and submit your findings.
Safety Guidelines:
- Always make sure to perform penetration testing in a controlled and isolated environment.
- Ensure that you have permission from the system owner before attempting any penetration testing.

Lab Questions:
1. What vulnerabilities did you identify in the Metasploitable VM using Nmap?
2. Which vulnerability did you choose to exploit, and why?
3. Describe the exploit you used and the steps you took to gain unauthorized access to the target system.
4. What information or access did you gain as a result of the successful exploit?
5. Based on your experience in this lab, what are some best practices for securing a system against the vulnerability you exploited?
