LESSON 5 PROFESSOR LAB INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction:
In this lab exercise, students will practice network penetration testing using the skills and knowledge they acquired during the lecture. They will be setting up a virtual network environment and simulating an attack on a vulnerable system using a popular penetration testing tool. 

Lab environment setup:
Ensure that students have the following tools and virtual machines installed and set up:

1. VMware Workstation
2. Kali Linux virtual machine
3. Ubuntu server virtual machine (with a vulnerable service or application)

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. Begin the lab by dividing the class into six groups. Assign each group a unique scenario based on different types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or buffer overflow.

2. Guide the students through setting up their virtual network environment in VMware Workstation. Ensure that each group's Kali Linux virtual machine is connected to their assigned Ubuntu server virtual machine.

3. Instruct students to use a network scanning tool like Nmap on their Kali Linux virtual machine to discover open ports and services on their target Ubuntu server.

4. Once students have identified potential vulnerabilities, have them research and choose an appropriate penetration testing tool or exploit from the Metasploit framework or other resources.

5. Guide students through the process of configuring and executing the selected exploit against their target system.

6. If the exploit is successful, encourage students to explore the target system, documenting their steps and any sensitive information they find.

7. Throughout the lab exercise, remind students to follow safety guidelines and ethical practices, such as not attempting any unauthorized access or causing damage to the systems.

8. Allow students to collaborate and share their experiences as they progress through the lab, but ensure that they complete their own work for their unique scenarios.

9. Provide support and guidance to students as they work through the lab exercise, answering any questions or helping troubleshoot issues as they arise.

10. Towards the end of the lab, bring the class together for a group discussion on their findings and experiences, allowing each group to present their unique scenario and the steps they took to complete the exercise.

Tips for guiding students:

- Encourage students to think critically and apply their understanding of network penetration testing concepts to solve their assigned scenarios.
- Be prepared to provide additional resources or recommendations for students who may struggle with configuring their environments or finding the right exploit.
- Ensure that students are adhering to ethical practices and not attempting any unauthorized access or causing damage to the systems.
- Facilitate collaboration and discussion among students, as sharing experiences can help deepen their understanding of the concepts being taught.
- Be prepared to address any technical issues that may arise during the lab exercise, such as problems with the virtual machines or networking configurations.
