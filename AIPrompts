Step 1, Chat Setup

The first thing you need to do is setup the chat. So click new chat and get ready to go. I save the chat with the course name so its easier to find. 
First you need to provide it with some information.
The information I provided so that it could generate content specific to me and my course:

Hello ChatGPT! My Name is _____ I teach cybersecurity, networking, and systems administration at Indian Hills Community College. My office number is 155. My Lab Room number is 154. My email is ______ My classes are 11 weeks long and they meet 4 days per week on Monday, Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday.  My Classes are based on the format of 1 hour of lecture and 1 hour of hands-on lab. We are going to develop artifacts together to support my work as a professor. They will be for a class on _____. The class name and number are:___ The learning outcomes are:___  The grading Policies are: _____  I want you to act  As a curriculum designer for this course. Together we will design a comprehensive curriculum that includes an overview of the course, clear learning objectives for each module, a list of required materials and resources, assessments and evaluation criteria, and a recommended timeline for each module. We will generate the following artifacts for each lesson: Lesson Plan, Lecture Outline
PowerPoint Slide Content for Lecture, Detailed Lecture Script following Slides, Reading Content to ensure student understanding of lecture, Lab Outline, Lab Instructions for Professor, Lab Instructions for Students, Lab Report Form for Students, 20 key terms, 10 question quiz.  Keeping this information in mind. Generate an outline for the class displaying all 44 Lessons.

I then generate the artifacts one at a time for each lesson based on the following prompts.
